    <h1>Tadah Studio</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>You launched this from Studio! Congratulations!</p>
    <p>To create a new place, go to File > New.</p>
    <p><strong>BEWARE!</strong> Old versions of Studio are very buggy, and I don't recommend them for long-term building. You should build a place in modern Roblox Studio (or Roblox Studio 2013 so you don't need to convert) and then convert it to XML format. Importing models with tools that use the modern XML format for Roblox is broken.</p>
    <p>Credit to all-knowing Bepis for helping out with Tadah.</p>
